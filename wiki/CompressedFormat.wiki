#summary Binary format of LZFX streams and files

== Buffer compression format ==

From lzfx.c:

{{{
    There are two kinds of structures in LZF/LZFX: literal runs and back
    references. The length of a literal run is encoded as L - 1, as it must
    contain at least one byte.  Literals are encoded as follows:

    000LLLLL <L+1 bytes>

    Back references are encoded as follows.  The smallest possible encoded
    length value is 1, as otherwise the control byte would be recognized as
    a literal run.  Since at least three bytes must match for a back reference
    to be inserted, the length is encoded as L - 2 instead of L - 1.  The
    offset (distance to the desired data in the output buffer) is encoded as
    o - 1, as all offsets are at least 1.  The binary format is:

    LLLooooo oooooooo           for backrefs of real length < 9   (1 <= L < 7)
    111ooooo LLLLLLLL oooooooo  for backrefs of real length >= 9  (L > 7)
